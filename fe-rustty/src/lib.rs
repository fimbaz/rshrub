//! # Rustty
//!
//! Rustty is a terminal UI library that provides a simple, concise abstraction over an
//! underlying terminal device.
//!
//! Rustty is based on the concepts of cells and events. A terminal display is an array of cells,
//! each holding a character and a set of foreground and background styles. Events are how a
//! terminal communicates changes in its state; events are received from a terminal, processed, and
//! pushed onto an input stream to be read and responded to.
//!
//! Futher reading on the concepts behind Rustty can be found in the
//! [README](https://github.com/cpjreynolds/rustty/blob/master/README.md)
